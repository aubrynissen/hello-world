# hello-world
a place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others

I'm Aubry. Pretty new to coding but really digging it so far. Into: 
  helping when I can, 
  hanging (read: eating/netflix) with my husband, family, and a few close friends, 
  my house plants, 
  planning and organization, 
  and getting out of a chair and moving around every one in a awhile.
